# Quintor Opdracht 6

How to run
> Make sure you have node.js installed, but I assume you already have.
> Open the project within a folder.
> Navigate into the program folder.
> Grab the folder url and copy it (example: "C:\Users\Johnknee\Documents\GitHub\QuintorOpdracht2\program").
> Open your command console (cmd) and navigate into the folder (cd [folder url]).
> Once you're in there, you can type "node app.js" and the server will run.
> Then open any browser and type in localhost:3000 in your url bar.

There are three pages you can visit
> / -> Homepage
> /login -> Login page
> /account -> Account page

They look similar to the intended pages, but they don't have the proper functionalities behind them. Ironic and stupid as it sounds, I haven't had the time to get to it after learning how to do it the Friday before the deadline and I kept running into errors I couldn't solve before I got help from a fellow student.
