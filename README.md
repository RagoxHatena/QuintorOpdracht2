This exercise is not complete yet as I do not know how I link the Angular application to the Spring Boot application.
I've done a bit of research, but every search I did got me to a webpage about testing in Spring Boot, so I kind of didn't have much to go off of  either... 
Either way, the application runs, it has a single unit test and it is connected to Travis CI. It doesn't meet the other requirements and as such, I cannot consider this complete yet and would love to get some guidance of those that have actually managed to do it.

Thank you in advance,
-Rick
